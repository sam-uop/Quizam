Central Government is responsible to nominate the governor for each state. Unlike elections of the President, there is no direct or indirect election for the post of Governor. The office of a governor is not a part of the union executive and is an independent constitutional office. The governor doesnâ€™t serve the union government and neither is subordinate to it. The nomination of a governor by the Union and his appointment by the President in India is based on the Canadian model of government. President can remove the Governor and the grounds upon which he may be removed are not laid down in the constitution. Governor may also get transferred from one state to another by the President. Governor also can be reappointed.",2)
